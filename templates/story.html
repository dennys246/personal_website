    Denny Schaedig is a Colorado native passionate about learning in every
    sense. This passion started as a drive to learn more about the world and in 2015
    drove Denny to pursue a Bachelor's in Neuroscience at the University
    of Colorado, Boulder. While honing his understanding of Neuroscience, he focused his studies on how our
    brains naturally learn, form memories and leverage what was learned. Along the way he 
    took courses on computer science and mathmatical models of cognition which ignited a 
    fierce passion and love for computer science, AI, and machine learning.
    <br><br>
    This passion ultimately led him to learn more about AI through first-hand experiences.
    He first started applying computer vision and machine learning to 4D fMRI data in 2018, ultimately
    training an AI (KleinNet) to understand how the brain functions during a cognitive task. These projects inspired 
    him to pursue a Master's in AI and machine learning through Colorado State University Global
    in 2022 to hone his skills. Denny has been leveraging these skills within the Neuroscience 
    field, building software and training AI to advance scientific research.
    <br><br>
    Denny currently works remotely as a Data and AI Engineer for the Laboratory for Child Brain Development 
    at Washington University in St. Louis preprocessing and analyzing
    neuroimaging data with traditional and AI approaches. In his free 
    time, Denny likes to build stuff he believes could help
    his communities. Currently he is training AvAI&trade; to predict avalanche 
    risk with real-time data to inform backcountry skiers of potential dangers.
    <br><br>In his free time, he also loves to learn new things. Currently he is learning the
    fine details of skiing through teaching and learning from the Professional Ski Instructor
    of America (PSIA). Alongside this he is learning how to snowboard and
    is getting ready to shred down his first double black this season!
